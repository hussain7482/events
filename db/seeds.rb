# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
   Event.create([{ 
   title: "annual function",
   description: "college annual function",
   start_time: "2022-10-03 10:00:00",
   end_time: "2022-10-03 05:00:00"
